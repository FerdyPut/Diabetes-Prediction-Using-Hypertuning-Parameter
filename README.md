# Diabetes Prediction Using Hypertuning Parameter

## Background:
Diabetes is one of the most dangerous non-communicable diseases, caused by excessive blood sugar levels. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 1 in 11 adults worldwide suffer from diabetes, totaling around 537 million people in 2021. Diabetes is also a leading cause of death globally.
Given the severity of this disease, I was motivated to develop a diabetes risk prediction system using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to support early detection, allowing individuals to assess their risk and take preventive actions accordingly.

## Project Details:

### Data Source:
Dataset obtained from Kaggle - Diabetes Prediction Dataset

### Objective:
To build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to determine the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various health-related features, and to evaluate the impact of using SMOTENC for handling class imbalance.

### Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression

### Methodology:
- Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization and handling class imbalance using SMOTENC (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous data).
- Experimental Design:
a) Baseline models (without SMOTENC).
b) Models trained with balanced data using SMOTENC.
c) Hyperparameter Tuning: Conducted using GridSearchCV to optimize each modelâ€™s performance.

### Model Evaluation:
Evaluation metrics used: Recall and ROC-AUC
The performance of models with and without SMOTENC will be compared to assess the effect of data balancing.
